"*Gone are the days when you have to spend a few precious years of your life in Art colleges, to create Art. Or you have got to born with sheer tallent*": Well, we are almost there. Have a look [here](https://www.midjourney.com/showcase/) .

Welcome to the world of AI based art generation. Where you are only limited by your imagination. You just think about what you want to see and AI will do the rest of the work.

### How it works :

In general, you may assume these art generators are basically AI systems trained in publicly available datasets. You just have to write down your imagination in a descriptive manner, and the AI system will generate art accordingly.

Here is my first attempt. I have keyed down "Wild Buffalo's dancing with bees and butterfly in desert under starry night beside fire". And the result is :

Well, it's not exactly what I wanted, but I kinda like it.  
You may try to create your own art [here](https://creator.nightcafe.studio/create).

### Tools to explore :

Probably the most talked about generator. You may try it for free initially (I guess up to 25 images). They have a discord server backed by a very helpful community. Results are realistic, and you can control output up to a great extent. For example, if you want to create a comic book, you need to create same character faces in different scenario. Kris has done exactly that using midjourney. Have a look [here](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=3331419273744376&set=pcb.3331419823744321) .

Very simple to use. Also, you can select among popular artistic styles. I found it good for generating some nice wallpapers.

This is an app, but you can also use it on the web. You can create art then sell it as NFT or buy it as high quality print. You can also remix your existing NFTs.

Dall-E 2 is probably the most anticipated tool for AI based image generation through natural language processing. But sadly, it's not available yet. You may join the waitlist [here](https://labs.openai.com/waitlist) . Till then, you may try dalle-mini. I didn't find it much useful compared to others, but I think I need to spend more time on this.

### So how is this useful for you ?

Well, Application of AI in any field is unlimited or restricted by imagination only. Below are a few use cases :

* Banner / Art work for social media.
    
* Illustartion / Art work for articles / books.
    
* [NFT creation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v40bYsj4N4)
    
* Wallpaper :)
    
* [Graphic Novel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGNHq4aNUSo)
    

### Conclusion :

I feel these AI tools will do the same to artists, what autotune did to voice artists. But still a long way to go for this. But remember, AI tools are trained in open internet filled with copyrighted artworks. So you may get copyright strike in case your artwork is similar to any copyrighted works. But, early adopters always make it big.
